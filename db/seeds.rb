# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
admin = User.create(firstName: 'Icarus', lastName: 'Software', email: 'icarus96119@gmail.com', attachment: '', password: '123456');
