I need a plugin "RESTRICT ON GENERIC CONDITION" that can be used any place where the user access to an activity or resource can be restricted. The plugin should be able to run a select statement that will return a true/false value (1/0) against an external database, and give access to the activity/resource is the value is true. If the value is false (or there is some error with the execution of the call), the activity/resource should not be visible. It must be possible to use the current userid and at least the course id as parameters in the call. E.g. "SELECT (username = "admin") FROM mdl_user WHERE id = &current_user_id" (or whatever the parameter for the currently logged in user is..)

I need to be able to reuse variables from Moodle context in the call, see https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Access_API

E.g. "SELECT (x=1) FROM ... WHERE userid = $user_id and courseif = "@courseid"


Well, I want to make restriction plugin.
and then we can input sql query on text input field when we add the restriction of any activity or resources.
So we have to execute sql query from the external database
and then we can input external db connection infos on settings of plugin modal
